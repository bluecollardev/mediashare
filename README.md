# Mediashare

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running the api

The API is composed of a core API with routes on it, an Authentication microservice, a postgres Auth database and a mongodb database for core data.

To run the back-end components from the root enter `npm run init:dev`, to bring them down run `npm stop:dev`. It is also possible to run the services separately, for example running just hte auth microservice or databases using docker-compose.

It's important to restart with npm run init:dev so the docker volumes will be restored.

## Code-generation

To seed the database make sure you have docker databases running. Then run `npm start seed:users`

This will seed with a small set of data, and 3 users. admin@example.com, user@example.com, guest@example.com each in their appropriate role.

The password is 'welcome1' but you can change that and the email config there.

## Generate client models

Run `npm run gen:api-client`

## Creating a new module

### command

Run `nest g resource resource-name` in the folder you want to insert it

choose `REST API` from the available options.

To extend the modules:

### Entity

Go to `entity/resource-name.entity.ts`

add teh @Entity() class decorator to the entity.

extend `BcBaseEntity<T>` with the current class type:

```js
import { Entity } from 'typeorm';
import { BcBaseEntity } from '@api';

@Entity()
export class Profile extends BcBaseEntity<Profile> {}
```

### Service

Go to to: `resource-name.service.ts`

Delete all the existing methods.

Extend the service to DataService. There are two generic types to add, the base Entity (ResourceName) and MongoRepository<UserName>:
`extends DataService<Profile, MongoRepository<Profile>>`

implement the constructor from with the appropriate injected service (see user.service.ts)

```js
 constructor(
  @InjectRepository(ResourceName)
  userRepository: MongoRepository<ResourceName>,
  logger: PinoLogger
) {
  super(userRepository, new ResourceBane(), logger);
}
```

### Controller

go to: `resource-name.controller.ts`

find all the +id in the service, and delete the `+`

### Module

Go to: `resource-name.module.ts`
s
add the module imports line:

```js

@Module[{
  ...
  imports: [..., ResourceNameModule],
  ...
}]

### Tests

follow the example in the user packages
```

If you get an error when nest starts one of the above steps was missed.

```javascript

@Module({
// this is the entity
imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([ResourceName)]],
controllers: [ResourceNameController],
providers: [ResourceNameService],
})
export class ProfileModule {}


```

## App Module

go too `app.module` (located in the src root of the project)`

add the module to the list of imports there.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace
